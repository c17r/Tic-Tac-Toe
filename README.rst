Reference implementation for ttt-lib
------------------------------------

text_ttt.py shows how simple it is to build a Tic-Tac-Toe application off the ttt package.  You can play the application as:

1. NPC vs NPC - not very exciting, will always end in a draw
2. Human vs NPC - you can choose either X or O.  Hope you are good!
3. Human vs Human - alternate moves

command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* -p [0|1|2]  - number of human players
* -m [X|O]    - marker to use in single human player game
